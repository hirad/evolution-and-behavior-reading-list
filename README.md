# Evolution And Behavior, Reading List

A number of us, in Vancouver, created and have been participating in an **Evolution and Behavioral Sciences** reading group for years now.

For quite a while there was no Internet presence to this group.

We coordinated in-person and over e-mail, read books and papers on evolution and behavioral sciences, and met every 2 to 4 weeks in a coffee shop to discuss what we read.

Eventually, many many years after this reading group was created, a meetup group had been created:
https://www.meetup.com/EvolutionAndBehavior/

This document lists out the material we have covered.


## Topics

Broadly speaking, (almost) all the topics have been on **Evolution and Behavioral Sciences**.

However, a specialist may use some of the following labels to describe some of topics we covered over the years:
archaeology,
behavioral ecology,
behavioral economics,
cultural evolution,
genetics,
evolutionary anthropology,
evolutionary biology,
evolutionary psychology,
moral psychology,
neuroscience,
psychometics.


## Tracks

Originally, there was just one track that meet every 2 weeks on Saturdays. (For a while this slowed down to meeting every 4 weeks. But later returned to every 2 weeks.)

Later, a Monday track was created that (usually) met every 4 weeks.
