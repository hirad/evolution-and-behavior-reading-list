# Evolution And Behavior, Reading List

A number of us, in Vancouver, created and have been participating in an **Evolution and Behavioral Sciences** reading group for years now.

For quite a while there was no Internet presence to this group.

We coordinated in-person and over e-mail, read books and papers on evolution and behavioral sciences, and met every 2 to 4 weeks in a coffee shop to discuss what we read.

Eventually, many many years after this reading group was created, a meetup group had been created:
https://www.meetup.com/EvolutionAndBehavior/

This document lists out the material we have covered.


## Topics

Broadly speaking, (almost) all the topics have been on **Evolution and Behavioral Sciences**.

However, a specialist may use some of the following labels to describe some of topics we covered over the years:
archaeology,
behavioral ecology,
behavioral economics,
cultural evolution,
genetics,
evolutionary anthropology,
evolutionary biology,
evolutionary psychology,
moral psychology,
neuroscience,
psychometics.


## Tracks

Originally, there was just one track that meet every 2 weeks on Saturdays. For a while this Saturday track slowed down to meeting every 4 weeks. But later returned to its every 2 weeks cadence.

Later, a Monday track was created that (usually) met every 4 weeks.

The cadence was sometimes adjusted as core individuals in the group had scheduling conflicts.


## Format

When books were read, we wouldn't read the whole book for one meeting.
But instead we would divide the book between many meetings.

At least one person would provide an overview of the reading, that would help facilitate the discussion.
(Usually there would be 1, 2, or 3 people providing overviews.)

Often others would jump in with comments or questions, while the overviews were being given.

(Not so much in the beginning, but after this had been going on for a number of years, we started often going to a restaurant afterwards to eat, drink, hang out, and socialize.
Often related discussions took place in this social setting.)
